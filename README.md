# PeopleCounter
in this repo i've build a project that counts people going in both directions (up and down) on the escalator through the specific regions

this project uses a tracker "sort" from : https://github.com/abewley/sort to run this project you need to have the sort.py file from above link.

Note: this will not work with every video. this will work only with people.mp4
